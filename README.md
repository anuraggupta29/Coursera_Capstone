<h1>IBM Data Science Capstone Project</h1>
<ul>
<li>It is my final submission for the IBM Data Science Capstone Project, involving extensive exploratory data analysis.</li>
<li>It uses k-means clustering to cluster the neighborhoods in toronto together (can be generalised to any city).</li>
<li>Uses knn classification to classify a new neighborhood to a cluster.</li>
<li>This project also required the use of web scraping, managing dataframes, plotting maps and visualising graphs.
